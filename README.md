## Introduction

It allows you to create translation from scratch, editing exisiting loclization and saving this to backend while being on the webpage the whole time.

This library is a **FREE** refinement of the existing solution with intuitive interface, thought through concept and high quality code with TypeScript under the hood.
It's developer oriented, which means full support and discussion open.

## Motivation

- When editing existring localization it's hard finding values in editor every time manually, moreover if you need to edit multiple languages at the same time.
- If you have dedicated translator or your _clients_ want to edit localization on their own in future, you need a "lolization editing unit", which not every team can afford it.

There is already existing plugin for it to enable editor, but it's currenly deprecated, not complete free and has constrained design.
